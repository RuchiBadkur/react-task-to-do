✅ 1. Start by Repeating and Clarifying the Task
Say this:

"Sure! So, you want me to build a basic To-Do app using React where the user can:

Add a task

Mark a task as complete/incomplete

And remove a task
Each task should visually reflect its completed status — like a line-through if completed."

"I'll be using useState to manage the task input and the list of todos. I’ll also use basic array methods like map and splice. Shall I begin?"

✅ 2. Start Explaining Your Thought Process While Coding
Explain each step as you write:

Step 1: useState for Managing State
```
const [task, setTask] = useState(""); // for tracking the input value
const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]); // for tracking the 
```
list of todos
Say this:

"I’m using useState to manage two things:

The current input value (task)

The list of todos (todos), which will be an array of objects — each having a task string and a boolean isComplete."

Step 2: Function to Add Task
```
const addTask = (task) => {
  task && setTodos([...todos, { task, isComplete: false }]);
  setTask("");
};
```
Say this:

"In addTask, I first check if the input is not empty. If it’s valid, I use the spread operator to create a new array with the new task object added at the end. Then, I clear the input field."

Step 3: Function to Remove Task
```
const handleRemove = (index) => {
  let newTodos = [...todos];
  newTodos.splice(index, 1);
  setTodos([...newTodos]);
};
```
Say this:

"To remove a task, I make a shallow copy of the array using the spread operator, then use splice to remove one item at the given index, and finally update the state."

🔍 Explain .splice() in Detail
"splice(index, 1) means:

Start at the given index

Remove 1 item
Unlike slice, splice modifies the original array and returns the removed elements."

🆚 Splice vs Slice
Method	Modifies Original Array	Returns New Array	Usage Example
splice()	✅ Yes	✅ Yes	Removing, replacing, or adding elements
slice()	❌ No	✅ Yes	Extracting a section without changing original

Step 4: Toggle Complete
```
const toggle = (index) => {
  let newTodos = [...todos];
  newTodos[index].isComplete = !newTodos[index].isComplete;
  setTodos([...newTodos]);
};
```
Say this:

"This function toggles the isComplete status of a task. Again, I create a copy of the array, flip the boolean, and update the state."

Step 5: Rendering
```
<ul>
  {todos.map((task, index) => (
    <li key={index} style={{ textDecoration: task.isComplete ? "line-through" : "none" }}>
      {task.task}
      <button onClick={() => toggle(index)}>Mark as complete</button>
      <button onClick={() => handleRemove(index)}>remove</button>
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>
```
Say this:

"I’m mapping through the todos array and rendering each task inside a <li>. If a task is complete, I show it with a line-through using inline styles. I’ve added buttons to mark it as complete or to remove it."

✅ 3. End by Recapping
Say this:

"So this is a simple To-Do app using controlled components and useState. I’ve used array operations like splice for deletion and toggling logic to update task completion. I’ve also kept the UI minimal and user-friendly. Would you like me to add localStorage or filtering features as well?"
